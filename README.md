# UL list (html5 template, typescript, singleton instance)

## <template> Tag

The template is an HTML5 element that stores HTML code fragments that are not displayed immediately when a page is loaded. This element can be duplicated and inserted into an HTML document. Templates are not rendered in the browser until you activate them. Typescript is used to get the content from a template and add it to the web page.
